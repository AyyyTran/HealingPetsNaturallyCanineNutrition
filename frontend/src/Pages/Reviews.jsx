                "I'm so grateful for the help that Karissa gave me when my pup
                had an ear infection. She was 100% correct when telling me to
                change my dog's diet. A week after making the switch to another
                protein food, my dog was better. Thank you for sharing your
                in-depth knowledge with me, Karissa, and for explaining the hows
                and whys regarding my pup's health. "

                "Our beloved boy Miles was exhibiting signs of IVDD and after
                numerous visits to several animal hospitals as far as six hours
                away from our permanent residence, with the last visit being
                with a highly decorated neurologist which resulted in a MRI. The
                neurologist discovered that Miles had a herniated disc and
                instructed use to put him on 30 days crate rest and prescribed a
                series of steroids. The doctor insinuated that surgery would be
                likely to fix the problem. After returning home we followed the
                doctor&apos;s instructions while staying in contact with
                Karissa. With her, we further discussed our frenchie&apos;s diet
                and the possibility that his condition could be being
                exasperated by the carbs in his diet. She then guided us,
                including doing at great deal of research on her end, to assist
                us in finding a company that could delivery high quality raw dog
                food that would meet the nutritional needs of our frenchie.
                Thanks to her and her knowledge our little Miles has been doing
                well for a year now. To this point we have been blessed to avoid
                a costly and grueling procedure. Karissa is truly a caring
                individual with a wealth of knowledge! We are very grateful for
                her help! "

                "Healing Pets Naturally Canine Nutrition has been a life changer
                for my dog, Sadey. Sadey was diagnosed with kidney disease 2.5
                years ago. Sadey had not been feeling well and was consuming
                large amounts of water, we took her to the vet where she was
                examined and had blood work done. Her kidney levels were very
                bad and we were told to put her on a Veterinarian Kidney Food as
                she was diagnosed with kidney disease. We tried the vet food and
                she was getting worse, she did not want to eat and for a Golden
                Retriever that is unheard of. I started to do some research and
                came across Karissa. She has helped us so much with Sadey. I had
                blood work done again and her kidney levels were starting to
                improve after a few months. To date Sadey&apos;s kidney levels
                in her blood are normal, vet said if she didn&apos;t know she
                had kidney disease they would never know and to keep doing what
                we are doing. Sadey is healthy, happy, full of energy and loves
                her food. Thank you so much Karissa for all your hard work that"
