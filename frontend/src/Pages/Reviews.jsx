                "I'm so grateful for the help that Karissa gave me when my pup
                had an ear infection. She was 100% correct when telling me to
                change my dog's diet. A week after making the switch to another
                protein food, my dog was better. Thank you for sharing your
                in-depth knowledge with me, Karissa, and for explaining the hows
                and whys regarding my pup's health. "

                "Our beloved boy Miles was exhibiting signs of IVDD and after
                numerous visits to several animal hospitals as far as six hours
                away from our permanent residence, with the last visit being
                with a highly decorated neurologist which resulted in a MRI. The
                neurologist discovered that Miles had a herniated disc and
                instructed use to put him on 30 days crate rest and prescribed a
                series of steroids. The doctor insinuated that surgery would be
                likely to fix the problem. After returning home we followed the
                doctor&apos;s instructions while staying in contact with
                Karissa. With her, we further discussed our frenchie&apos;s diet
                and the possibility that his condition could be being
                exasperated by the carbs in his diet. She then guided us,
                including doing at great deal of research on her end, to assist
                us in finding a company that could delivery high quality raw dog
                food that would meet the nutritional needs of our frenchie.
                Thanks to her and her knowledge our little Miles has been doing
                well for a year now. To this point we have been blessed to avoid
                a costly and grueling procedure. Karissa is truly a caring
                individual with a wealth of knowledge! We are very grateful for
                her help! "

                "Healing Pets Naturally Canine Nutrition has been a life changer
                for my dog, Sadey. Sadey was diagnosed with kidney disease 2.5
                years ago. Sadey had not been feeling well and was consuming
                large amounts of water, we took her to the vet where she was
                examined and had blood work done. Her kidney levels were very
                bad and we were told to put her on a Veterinarian Kidney Food as
                she was diagnosed with kidney disease. We tried the vet food and
                she was getting worse, she did not want to eat and for a Golden
                Retriever that is unheard of. I started to do some research and
                came across Karissa. She has helped us so much with Sadey. I had
                blood work done again and her kidney levels were starting to
                improve after a few months. To date Sadey&apos;s kidney levels
                in her blood are normal, vet said if she didn&apos;t know she
                had kidney disease they would never know and to keep doing what
                we are doing. Sadey is healthy, happy, full of energy and loves
                her food. Thank you so much Karissa for all your hard work that
                you have done for Sadey with her supplements and meal plans.

                My husband and I got our French Bulldog puppy, Jellybear, at ten
                weeks. From the time we brought him home, I noticed he was
                shaking his head and scratching his ears a lot. We cleaned his
                ears and they were filthy. He would also lick at his paws and in
                between his toes and I had nightmares of the same allergies that
                had plagued our first Frenchie, Bambi, for the entire time we
                had her (7 years - we adopted her as a retired breeder at
                three). Bambi really suffered and despite many vet trips and
                medications, we never got to the bottom of it to give her
                relief. At the end of her life, her ears were like leather, over
                half of her body was hairless, and she would have small crusty
                bumps all over her back, despite feeding her “premium” food and
                doing everything we could. It was maddening and upsetting to see
                her in such distress. When Jelly started scratching, I detailed
                our problem and posted a question about food recommendations on
                a popular Frenchbulldog forum. Luckily for us, Karissa
                responded. She was so concerned and attentive to Jelly&apos;s
                situation. Over the next couple of months, Karissa provided us
                endless guidance on the most hypoallergenic commercial foods
                available and homeopathic remedies to quell Jelly&apos;s
                allergies before they took hold. These interventions worked and
                he soon stopped itching and licking and we&apos;ve only cleaned
                his ears a few times over the two years we have had him, and
                that has just been as a precaution, not because of any symptoms
                he has presented. I am so grateful that Karissa found us and
                chose to respond. She spent many hours preparing recommendation
                and offering tips of things to try. Not only that, but I
                marveled at how invested she was in Jell&apos;s progress and it
                was often that she would check back with us and inquire about
                his health. We owe her debt of gratitude for helping us and
                saving little Jelly from the myriad of allergies that plagued
                Bambi and that can be prevalent in the breed. I highly endorse
                Karissa to anyone seeking nutritional counseling and holistic
                remedies to help their Frenchies. IMO, they are the best,
                sweetest, most affectionate breed out there and deserve our
                best. It is such a relief to see Jellybear happy and
                comfortable! Thanks, Karissa!!!
