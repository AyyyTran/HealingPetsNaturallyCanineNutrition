        The Real Culprit: Low-Quality Pet Food
      </h2>
      <p className="text-sm p-4 mx-auto lg:w-1/2">
        Many health issues stem from low-quality pet food. Pet food companies
        prioritize marketing and profit over your pet's health. They can include
        undisclosed ingredients, chemicals, and even garbage in their products,
        contributing to the rising prevalence of health issues in our beloved
        companions.
